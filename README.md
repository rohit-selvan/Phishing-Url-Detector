# Phishing-Url-Detector

A heuristic-based Phishing URL Detection Tool built with Python and Tkinter to analyze URLs and predict if they are potentially malicious. This project helps identify phishing links by detecting suspicious patterns and warning users in real-time.

Real-time URL Analysis: Detects potentially phishing URLs based on patterns. Heuristic-based Detection: Checks for non-HTTPS links, suspicious keywords, long URLs, and uncommon top-level domains. Simple GUI: User-friendly interface with color-coded results (red for phishing, green for safe). Fast and Lightweight: Instant feedback for every analyzed URL.
